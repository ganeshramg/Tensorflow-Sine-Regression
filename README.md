# Sine-Regression
My first TF code without referring external sources

### Created x and y, where y is sin(x)
### Added noise to both x and y

### Defined variables, placeholders, model, error_cost, optimizer
#### Since I have a low config system, I'd defined the variables slightly near the real values
### Run Session and plotted the prediction with original Data
